The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) defines a communication protocol used 
to exchange biological annotations. It is motivated by the idea that annotations 
should not be provided by single centralized databases, but instead be spread 
over multiple sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS servers, is separated
from visualization, which is done by DAS clients. The original DAS protocol was 
designed to serve annotation of genomic sequences. We have extended the protocol 
to be applicable to macromolecular structures. This project contains the source code 
for SPICE, a DAS client that can be used to visualize protein sequence and structure 
annotations.
